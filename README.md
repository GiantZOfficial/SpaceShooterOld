# SpaceShooter

## About
Repository for all the SpaceShooter builds from the first one to the last updated. The official page of the game is [here](https://giantzofficial99.itch.io/spaceshooter). Why are we using this repository? We want to keep every build in one place and just the latest update on itch.io. We are still deciding if we need an open-source project. For any type of support contact <i>giuseppe.pastena23@gmail.com</i>
